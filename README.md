# Vroom 🚗💨

> **Interactive SaaS driving school platform** — built for students, instructors, and administrators.

Vroom is a full-featured, dark-themed web application powered by **Angular 21** and **Tailwind CSS**. It delivers a seamless, role-based experience across three distinct user portals: a student learning hub, a comprehensive instructor management suite, and a platform-wide admin console — all backed by a Spring Boot REST API with JWT authentication.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | [Angular 21](https://angular.dev/) — standalone components, signals, `@if` / `@for` control flow |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — custom design tokens, dark theme |
| HTTP | Angular `HttpClient` with JWT interceptor |
| State | Angular Signals (`signal`, `computed`) — no NgRx |
| Routing | Angular Router — lazy-loaded standalone components |
| Forms | Angular `FormsModule` (template-driven) |
| Build | [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) |
| Backend | Spring Boot 3 REST API (separate repo) |

## 🎨 Design System

Vroom uses a custom dark theme built on top of Tailwind:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `vroom-black` | `#0A0A0F` | Page backgrounds |
| `vroom-accent` | `#FF4D1C` | Primary CTA, highlights |
| Amber | `#F59E0B` | Warnings, pending states |
| Green | `#10B981` | Success, passed states |
| Blue | `#3B82F6` | Info, instructor accents |

**Typography:**
- `Syne` — display headings (`font-display`)
- `DM Sans` — body text (`font-body`)
- `JetBrains Mono` — code / numeric values (`font-mono`)

**Stat numbers** always use `font-body font-bold tabular-nums` for consistent alignment.

## 👤 User Roles

Vroom has three roles, each with its own sidebar navigation and guarded routes:

| Role | Default redirect | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `STUDENT` | `/dashboard` | Student portal + assignments |
| `INSTRUCTOR` | `/dashboard/instructor` | Instructor portal (read student data, create scenarios, assign) |
| `ADMIN` | `/admin/dashboard` | Full platform access including user management |

Roles are stored in the JWT and enforced both client-side (route guards) and server-side (Spring Security `@PreAuthorize`).
